## Work in progress

This website is a work-in-progress implementation of my homemade physics engine.

The [Drafts](./drafts) page holds my preliminaries experiments to get myself familiar with different math concepts.
The [Tests engine](./engineTests) page is had various small projects using the engine allowing me to test it while I implement it.
